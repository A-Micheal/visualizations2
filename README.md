# Visualizations2
This project is a simple but visually insightful data-visualization task where I explore tipping behavior using the famous Seaborn “tips” dataset.  I used Seaborn’s jointplot and additional customization to show the relationship between total bill and tip amount, while also comparing differences by gender.
## Project Objective    
The objective of this assignment was to create a jointplot using Seaborn, apply any optional customization, and extract meaningful observations from the resulting visualization.
## Tools and Libraries
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

## Key Insights
- There is a clear positive relationship between total bill amounts and tip values.  
- Male and female customers follow similar tipping patterns.  
- Most bills fall between 10 and 25 dollars, and most tips fall between 2 and 4 dollars.
